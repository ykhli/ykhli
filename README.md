### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a cartoonist, engineer, product manager & investor. ðŸ’» I work at @a16z during the day & draw cartoons/write code at night.

My latest cartoon project is the [AI Explained series](https://ai-explained.yoko.dev/introduction) -- explaining complex AI concepts in simple terms w/ cartoons. 

Some projects I built recently: [AI-town](https://github.com/a16z-infra/AI-town), [companion-app](https://github.com/a16z-infra/companion-app), [AI-getting-started](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-getting-started), [local-ai-stack](https://github.com/ykhli/local-ai-stack), [AI-tamago](https://github.com/ykhli/AI-tamago), [multi-modal-starter-kit](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/multi-modal-starter-kit/), [AI-raspberry-pi-starter-kit](https://github.com/ykhli/AI-RPi-detection)...
